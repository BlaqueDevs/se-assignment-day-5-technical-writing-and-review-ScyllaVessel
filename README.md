+Knowing my audience's expertise level will determine the level of technical breakdown of terms and visuals explanations used and method of delivery.
+If my audience are tech experts, I'll simply present technical and complicated terms as they are but also for reference purposes include a key whereas if they are regular folks, I will have to break down the technical terms into regular english to ensure that they understand better. Same applies for diagrams/visuals which I will have to explain in more detail to ensure that they are able to understand.
